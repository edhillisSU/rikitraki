# RikiTraki

This repository contains the code for my personal hiking log: [RikiTraki.com](http://rikitraki.com). The data is separately maintained under a git submodule over [here](https://github.com/jimmyangel/rikitrakidata).

**RikiTraki is currently under development** and there are still a few things that need to be done to make it easy for others to peruse, such as:

* Complete the grunt scripts to fully automate build and deploy processes
* Add update scripts for track data (currently semi-manual process)
